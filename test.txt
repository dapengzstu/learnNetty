The java.io package contains nearly every class you might ever need to perform input and output (I/O) in Java. All these streams represent an input source and an output destination. The stream in the java.io package supports many data such as primitives, object, localized characters, etc.
A stream can be defined as a sequence of data. There are two kinds of Streams −

InPutStream − The InputStream is used to read data from a source.

OutPutStream − The OutputStream is used for writing data to a destination.
